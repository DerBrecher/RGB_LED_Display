# RGB LED Display Driver Libary
This libary can be used to display Strings on an addressable RGB LED Matrix. (Default Size 5 LEDs high and 19 wide)
It requires the [NeoPixelBus libary](https://github.com/Makuna/NeoPixelBus). Support for FastLED is still embbeded in the libary but NeoPixelBus is recommended due to DMA capability.
